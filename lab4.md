## Lab Report 4: Utilizing Terminal Controls
---
Objective: Discuss about github, speeding up work using keyboard with terminal, and ssh. 
---
Now before I get into the steps and the main components I need for this lab report, I would like to first display the steps that 
were used and the ones of focus. 

The Steps Are:
1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Setup Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

Steps 4-9 are important and of focus for the lab. 

Now I will list each steps as parts just for the sake of logical flow.
